In this project, I analyzed a dataset of customer data from a bike company. The dataset contained information such as customer ID, gender, marital status, age, income, education, occupation, home owner status, number of cars owned, commute distance, region, and whether they bought a bike or not.

My goal was to create a dashboard that would show the relationship between different customer attributes and their bike purchase behavior. To do this, I performed the following steps:

- I cleaned the data by removing duplicates and replacing values in the marital status and gender columns with more descriptive labels.
- I created a new column for age group using a formula that categorized customers into young, middle age, or old based on their age.
- I created 4 charts based on the pivot tables: a bar chart for income and gender, a line chart for commute distance and bike purchase, an area chart for age group and bike purchase, and a line chart for customers having car and still purchased bike.

The dashboard provides insights into the customer segments that are more likely to buy bikes from the company. For example, it shows that male customers have a higher average income and a higher bike purchase rate than female customers. It also shows that customers who have shorter commute distances are more likely to buy bikes than those who have longer commute distances. Finally, it shows that Middle age customers(31-53) are the most likely to buy bikes, followed by old age customers, while young customers are the least likely to buy bikes.

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, data visualization, and dashboard creation using Excel. It also showcases my ability to use formulas, functions, pivot tables, and charts to manipulate and present data in a meaningful way.
